In this work, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify image restoration and enhancement tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range reconstruction, and super-resolution.

## 1. Abstract

It is challenging but highly desired to acquire high-quality photos with clear content in low-light environments. Although multi-image processing methods (using burst, dual-exposure, or multi-exposure images) have made significant progress in addressing this issue, they typically focus exclusively on specific restoration or enhancement tasks, being insufficient in exploiting multi-image. Motivated by that multi-exposure images are complementary in denoising, deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, and super-resolution, we propose to utilize bracketing photography to unify restoration and enhancement tasks in this work. Due to the difficulty in collecting real-world pairs, we suggest a solution that first pre-trains the model with synthetic paired data and then adapts it to real-world unlabeled images. In particular, a temporally modulated recurrent network (TMRNet) and self-supervised adaptation method are proposed. Moreover, we construct a data simulation pipeline to synthesize pairs and collect real-world images from 200 nighttime scenarios. Experiments on both datasets show that our method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art multi-image processing ones.

## 5. Note

### 5.1 Evaluation Method

- Note that the evaluation method is different from that of 'Bracketing Image Restoration and Enhancement Challenges on NTIRE 2024'.
- Here, we exclude invalid pixels around the image for evaluation, which is more reasonable. 
- Related explanations can be found in **Appendix B** in our [revised paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.00766v3.pdf).
- We recommend that you use the new evaluation method in your future work.


### 5.2 Parameter Options

- You can specify which GPU to use by `--gpu_ids`, e.g., `--gpu_ids 0,1`, `--gpu_ids 3`, `--gpu_ids -1` (for CPU mode). In the default setting, all GPUs are used. 
- You can refer to [options](./options/base_options.py) for more arguments.
